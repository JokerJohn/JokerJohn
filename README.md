# ðŸš€ Welcome to My GitHub Page! ðŸ‘‹

Hello there, fellow GitHub enthusiasts! I'm a passionate Ph.D. student at the Robotics Institute of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, currently conducting cutting-edge research under the guidance of Professor Ping Tan ([homepage link](https://www.ece.ust.hk/eeptan)). From 2021 to 2023, I had the privilege of working at the IADC Laboratory under the supervision of Professor Ming Liu, where I focused on large-scale outdoor mapping and localization using LiDAR in the context of autonomous driving scenarios. Since 2024, as part of Professor Tan's research group, my research interests have expanded to include indoor and outdoor localization using LiDAR and vision-based techniques.

## ðŸŒŸ Research Interests

- LiDAR-based mapping and localization
- Vision-based localization techniques
- Autonomous driving scenarios
- Indoor and outdoor localization

## ðŸŽ‰ Beyond Research

While I'm deeply committed to my research, I also believe in living life to the fullest! I have a diverse range of interests that keep me energized and inspired. I'm an avid street dancer, love going on adventurous hikes, enjoy the tranquility of rowing, and can never resist a good gaming session. I firmly believe that while research is important, maintaining a healthy body and enjoying life should always be a top priority. Let's strive for balance together!
