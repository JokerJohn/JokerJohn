# 🚀 Welcome to My GitHub Universe! 🌌

Hey there, fellow GitHub adventurers! 🌟 I'm thrilled to have you here in my cosmic corner of the digital universe. Allow me to introduce myself—I'm a Ph.D. student at the Robotics Institute of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), currently embarking on an exciting research journey under the guidance of the brilliant Professor [Ping Tan](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/pingtan). 🤖🔬

## 🛰️ Research Odyssey

From 2021 to 2023, I had the privilege of working at the [IADC](https://ram-lab.com/) Lab under the mentorship of Professor [Ming Liu](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page/LIU-Ming/eelium). There, I delved into the fascinating realm of large-scale outdoor mapping and localization using LiDAR, specifically in autonomous driving scenarios. Starting in 2020, I have been fortunate to receive research guidance, training, and collaboration from [Dr. Jin Wu](https://zarathustr.github.io/) and [Dr. Jianhao Jiao](https://gogojjh.github.io/). They have been my de facto mentors, and their support in both my academic and personal life has been invaluable. Words cannot express my gratitude for their guidance and assistance.🚗🗺️

Fast forward to 2024 and beyond, as a member of Professor Ping Tan's research group, my focus has shifted to exploring the frontiers of indoor and outdoor localization using LiDAR and vision-based techniques. It's an exhilarating ride, pushing the boundaries of what's possible! 🌍📡

## 🕺 Life Beyond the Lab

While research is my passion, I firmly believe in embracing the joys of life beyond the lab walls. When I'm not immersed in code and algorithms, you can find me grooving to the beats of street dance, conquering trails on exhilarating hikes, gliding through the waters on a rowing adventure, or embarking on epic quests in the virtual gaming world. 🎮🏃‍♂️🚣‍♂️

Remember, my fellow explorers, while striving for excellence in research is admirable, prioritizing your well-being and savoring the wonders of life is equally essential. Let's inspire each other to find that perfect balance! 🌈💪
